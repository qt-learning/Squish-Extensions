# Squish-Extensions

This is the repo for the Squish-Extensions course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started

The files provided are the test suites and the demo apps used with the tests. They provide a reference for the workflows covered in the course section.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Squish for Qt installed from the qt.io website. We Recommend using the Squish IDE in order to follow along with the content in the videos.

App_squish_extensions_section_2_to_3: Qt application used as the AUT for sections 2 and 3. The application contains a few components which are part of Qt Quick Controls, and a custom button. Used to demonstrate how Squish recognizes these components using QML extensions. Requieres Qt 6.5, tested with with Qt 6.5.2 MinGw 64-bit

suite_squish_extensions_section2: Examples to demonstrate how Squish records a test which uses Qt Quick Controls components, with and without a proper QML extension. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

suite_squish_extensions_section3: Example to demonstrate how Squish records a test which uses custom components, with and without a proper QML extension. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.
